## Background

## Data Structures Used
Customized my own grid Button that had specific information such as:
Row
Column
Image (if any, or else 0/null!)
Layout params that contain row & column info that can EASILY be manipulated!

In order to do this project, I had to use a Software called Carla which is basically an open source autonomous driving simulator. It’s an API for Vehicle control, so by using Python, I can communicate the car’s movements and interactions within the simulation. It’s like a client-server architecture where I’m sending commands from the Python Client into the Carla Server to drive a car on virtual roads and racetracks. This CARLA software is open-source and free for everyone to download and use, making it fair for everyone to test their code on this free simulator.

## Objectives
Program Driving Simulation using 
- Python
- Vehicle Control Modelling Strategies

Implement PID Control Methods
- Longitudinal Control (Throttle/Braking)
- Lateral Control (Steering)

Utilized Python & CARLA Simulation Cohesively
- Control vehicle to follow race track
- Navigate through preset waypoints along predefined path (think Google Maps!)
- Receive information of relative position & velocity 
- Update/Command steering angle & throttle/velocity profiles from Python to CARLA
- Adjust Steering Angle & Speed Profiles as Needed
- Must reach waypoints at certain desired speeds




 That is so funny! :joy:
