I programmed a 2-minute driving simulation of an autonomous car driving on a racetrack on CARLA, an open source virtual driving simulator. By utilizing Python and lateral/longitudinal vehicle control modeling strategies, I was able to adjusting its speed profiles to communicate the car's movements and interactions on the track.

I Utilized Scikit-learn machine learning and Pandas data manipulation Python libraries to make predictions about the qualitative and quantitative stats of the entire Pokémon Universe for Linear Regression and k-Nearest Neighbor Classification analysis. Pokémon datasets were prepped using subsets of a DataFrame that were split into training and testing sets for both machine learning models.

Collaborated as a team to design a single-seat, off-road Baja on SolidWorks to compete in the SAE 2021 competition. Implemented Nissan’s ATTESA AWD powertrain design system to electromechanically actuate a multiplate clutch pack using an electric motor and a rotating, planetary geartrain design to dynamically split power from the engine to both front and rear axles by transferring 475 ft-lbs. of torque, allowing the driver to safely corner and race with ease.
